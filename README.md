# problem-solving-101

In all the other repositories, we are trying to have a proper problem solving approach, documented in the README.MD for each repository. 


0. Need Identification (Why)

This is the stage where you identify the need for solving a problem. You consider the impact of the problem, who it affects, and why it's worth solving. For instance, in the tournament problem, the need could be "There is a requirement for a fair and efficient system to determine the winner in a series of games or competitions."

1. Problem Definition (What)

Here, you would articulate the specific problem you're trying to solve based on the identified need. In the tournament problem, this step would involve stating that you need to find the team with the most points, with each win granting three points.

2. Contextual Understanding (When)

It's important to understand the specific circumstances or context in which the problem exists. This could include understanding when the problem occurs, under what conditions, and any constraints that exist. In the tournament problem, the context could be "The solution should work for any number of teams and games, and should handle ties appropriately."

3. Conceptual Solution (How)

This is where you devise a conceptual or theoretical solution to the problem. It might not be the final solution, but it forms a basis to start the actual problem-solving process.

4. Discuss Solution Alternatives

Discuss and evaluate potential alternative solutions to the problem.

5. Initial Approach/Drafting

Once a solution is chosen, a prototype or draft solution is created.

6. Optimization/Finalization

After testing and refining the initial draft, the solution is optimized and finalized.

7. Validation

Finally, the solution is tested with various test cases to ensure its correctness and efficiency.

This expanded problem-solving process provides a more comprehensive view, starting from why the problem is worth solving, through how to solve it, and finally, how to validate the solution.
